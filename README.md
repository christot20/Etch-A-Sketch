# Etch-A-Sketch
Students were tasked to create a project similar to a 
sketchpad and Etch-a-Sketch where the user would be able
to choose a specific size grid to draw on, a color to draw on,
be able to erase/clear the grid, and use the mouse to draw on the
grid.

1. Use of Javascript and conditional statements.
2. Use of DOM manipulation for changing colors of grid/button functionality.
3. Dedicated functions for each button/mode user is in.
4. Customizability with simple interface and design.
5. Use of Git for version control.
6. Use of HTML/CSS for styling and structure.


What I learned:
1. Advanced Javascript DOM manipulation functions/tactics.
2. Functions being used for storing code in organized blocks.
3. How to loop in Javascript and create elements into HTML page.
4. How to use version control to save work that will need to be changed later.
5. JS DOM Manipulation and use of HTML, CSS, and JS in one project together

What's Next:
1. Learning SASS and PostCSS
2. Mobile First Development
3. Learning/use of objects in JS

Project led by The Odin Project.
